# VocabMaster - Abstract

## Abstract

VocabMaster is a mobile application designed to enhance English vocabulary learning through systematic word management, daily progress tracking, and AI-powered sentence generation. The application allows users to store English words with Turkish translations, track their learning history via a calendar interface, and generate contextual example sentences through API integration. Currently implemented features include word storage, sentence generation, and progress monitoring with gamification elements such as learning streaks and XP points. Future development plans include speech recognition and pronunciation practice features, as well as an advanced reading comprehension system that creates personalized passages and exercises using words from the user's learned vocabulary, enabling comprehensive language practice in context.
